# Chain Integration Governance Proposals

New chains are onboarded to the Axelar Amplifier through [community governance](/resources/community/community-pool-proposals). In general, you will need to submit five governance proposals to integrate your chain: 

- Proposal to instantiate the verifier contract
- Proposal to instantiate the gateway contract
- Proposal to instantiate the prover contract
- Proposal to register your chain with the router
- Proposal to authorize your prover with the [Amplifier multisig contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/blob/main/contracts/multisig/src/msg.rs)

For example, EVM chain integrators should be using an `instantiate-contract` proposal to use existing `code_id`s, but teams with customized contract needs should use a `store-instantiate` proposal to both store and instantiate their custom code.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Axelar command-line interface](/learn/cli)
- 2,000 AXL for each proposal, either from your [own wallet](/resources/community/community-pool-proposals#create-a-local-wallet) or through a community member who can fund the proposal within one hour of posting
- A running [RPC endpoint](/resources/rpc/resources) or [Axelar node](/node/config-node)
- Experience with the appropriate Amplifier CosmWasm contracts and interfaces for integrating a chain (i.e. completed the [Integrate a Chain](/dev/amplifier/chain-integration/integrate-a-chain) tutorial)

## Community Forum introduction

You will need to introduce your chain to the community in order for Axelar token holders to vote for your proposals. This should be done on the governance section of the [Axelar Community Forum](https://community.axelar.network/c/governance2/33). Make a community introduction post that precedes and can be referenced by any on-chain proposals. It should include the following information:

- Background
- Governance details
- Pre-deployed source chain gateway address
- Plan for funding rewards pools

All of your on-chain proposals will refer back to this introduction, so make sure to be thorough. You should stay present and engage with any questions or comments during the seven-day feedback period, which can include public comments as well as a security council review. When the feedback period is over, submit your on-chain governance proposals to finish the integration of your chain.

## Proposal to instantiate the verifier contract

<tabs>

<tab-item title="EVM integrators">

If you are integrating an EVM chain, you can submit a proposal to instantiate the pre-deployed verifier contract using its existing `code_id` (`234`).

```bash
export CODE_ID=234
export ACCOUNT="axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj" # Devnet governance address, change to Testnet when Amplifier is deployed there
export CHAIN_ID="axelartestnet-lisbon-3"
export RPC="https://axelartest-rpc.quickapi.com:443"
```

```bash
axelard tx gov submit-proposal instantiate-contract $CODE_ID \
    --from wallet \
    --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 \
    --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \
    --node $RPC \
    --admin [your wallet address]
```

</tab-item>

<tab-item title="Non-EVM integrators">

1. Once the feedback period has passed, create a JSON file with the proposal and save it to a file, such as `store-instantiate-verifier.json`:

    ```bash
    {
        "title": "Store and instantiate verifier contract for [chain]",
        "description": "Store and instantiate verifier contract for [chain]",
        "governance_address": "axelar1zlr7e5qf3sz7yf890rkh9tcnu87234k6k7ytd9",
        "service_registry_address":"axelar1c9fkszt5lq34vvvlat3fxj6yv7ejtqapz04e97vtc9m5z9cwnamq8zjlhz",
        "service_name":"validators",

        "deposit": "2000000000uaxl"
    }
    ```

1. In your terminal, create a variable for the proposal such as `INSTANTIATE_VERIFIER_GOV_PROPOSAL` and set its value to the path of your JSON file:

    ```bash
    export INSTANTIATE_VERIFIER_GOV_PROPOSAL="/Users/you/Projects/Axelar/store-instantiate-verifier.json"
    ```

1. Submit the proposal as a JSON file:

    ```bash
    export ACCOUNT="axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj" # Devnet governance address, change to Testnet when Amplifier is deployed there
    export CHAIN_ID="axelartestnet-lisbon-3"
    export RPC="https://axelartest-rpc.quickapi.com:443"
    ```

    ```bash
    axelard tx gov submit-proposal store-instantiate $INSTANTIATE_VERIFIER_GOV_PROPOSAL \
        --from wallet \
        --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 \
        --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \

    ```

## Costs

Each proposal requires a 2,000 AXL deposit to submit. These funds will be refunded if votes reach quorum. The Axelar Network currently requires a 33.4% quorum for staked tokens.

## Voting period

There is a three-day (72-hour) voting period for all mainnet proposals.
