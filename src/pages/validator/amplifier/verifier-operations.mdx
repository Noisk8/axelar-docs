The Axelar Virtual Machine (AVM) and Amplifier are currently under active development, so these instructions are likely to change. Please check back frequently for updates.

## Approvals

### Approve a verifier or verifier set

Each verifier in a verifier set must use `ampd` to bond and register chain support themselves. On testnet and mainnet, community governance will call the following to authorize them:

```bash
axelard tx wasm execute [service registry address] '{"authorize_workers":{"workers":[list of worker addresses], "service_name":[service-name]}}' --from key --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2
```

## Rewards

There is one [rewards contract](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/blob/main/doc/src/contracts/rewards.md) for all chain integrations. Rewards are paid out in $AXL.

### How rewards are calculated

Every action earns rewards within `n` epochs. `n` more epochs will be paid out based on what has already been paid. There is a single global parameter for each epoch called `rewards_per_epoch`, in `Uint128`. Later, there will be one per pool. 

There is a [threshold of weighted votes](https://github.com/axelarnetwork/axelar-amplifier/blob/main/contracts/voting-verifier/src/msg.rs#L25) required for voting to be considered complete for a particular message. Verifiers must hit that threshold for payout.

### Check a rewards pool

To check a rewards pool:

```bash
axelard tx wasm execute $CONTRACT_ADDRESS '' --from validator --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2
axelard q wasm contract-state smart [rewards contract address] '{"rewards_pool":{"pool_id":{"chain_name":[chain-name],"contract":[address of voting verifier or multisig]}}}'
```

`contract` is the address of the voting verifier for the chain when querying for voting rewards, but the global multisig (not multisig prover) address when querying for signing.

### Add rewards to a pool or chain

To add rewards to a pool:

```bash
axelard tx wasm execute [rewards contract address] '{"add_rewards":{"pool_id":{"chain_name":[chain-name],"contract":[address of voting verifier or multisig]}}}' --amount [amount to add] --from [key] --gas auto --gas-adjustment 2 
```
