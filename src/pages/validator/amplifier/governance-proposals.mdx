## Verifier Governance Proposals

Changes are made to existing Amplifier chain settings through [community governance](/resources/community/community-pool-proposals). You will need to submit a governance proposal to modify these settings.

## Prerequisites

- Access to the [Axelar command-line interface](/learn/cli)
- 2,000 AXL for each proposal, either from your [own wallet](/resources/community/community-pool-proposals#create-a-local-wallet) or through a community member who can fund the proposal within one hour of posting
- A running [RPC endpoint](/resources/rpc/resources) or [Axelar node](/node/config-node)
- Experience with the appropriate Amplifier CosmWasm contracts and interfaces for integrating a chain (i.e. completed the [Integrate a Chain](/dev/amplifier/chain-integration/integrate-a-chain) tutorial)

## Community Forum introduction

You will need to introduce your chain to the community in order for Axelar token holders to vote for your proposals. This should be done on the governance section of the [Axelar Community Forum](https://community.axelar.network/c/governance2/33). Make a community introduction post that precedes and can be referenced by any on-chain proposals. It should include the following information:

- Background
- Governance details
- Pre-deployed source chain gateway address
- Plan for funding rewards pools

All of your on-chain proposals will refer back to this introduction, so make sure to be thorough. You should stay present and engage with any questions or comments during the seven-day feedback period, which can include public comments as well as a security council review. When the feedback period is over, submit your on-chain governance proposals to finish the integration of your chain.

## Change a chainâ€™s verifier set

1. Once the feedback period has passed, create a JSON file with the proposal and save it to a file, such as `change-verifier-set.json`:

    ```bash
    {
        "title": "Change verifier set for [chain]",
        "deposit": "2000000000uaxl",
        {
        "authorize_workers":
            {
        "workers":
            [
                "axelar1d73v2p9gdk2usxhh5k9kham2s42ccrydrd67hg"
            ],
        "service_name":"validators"
            }
        }
    }
    ```

1. In your terminal, create a variable for the proposal such as `CHANGE_VERIFIER_SET_GOV_PROPOSAL` and set its value to the path of your JSON file:

    ```bash
    export CHANGE_VERIFIER_SET_GOV_PROPOSAL="/Users/you/Projects/Axelar/change-verifier-set.json"
    ```

1. Submit the proposal as a JSON file:

    ```bash
    export ACCOUNT="axelar10d07y265gmmuvt4z0w9aw880jnsr700j7v9daj" # Devnet governance address, change to Testnet when Amplifier is deployed there
    export CHAIN_ID="axelartestnet-lisbon-3"
    export RPC="https://axelartest-rpc.quickapi.com:443"
    ```

    ```bash
    axelard tx gov submit-proposal execute-contract $CHANGE_VERIFIER_SET_GOV_PROPOSAL \
        --from wallet \
        --gas auto --gas-adjustment 1.5 \
        --chain-id $CHAIN_ID \
    ```
